            <p>The problem statement identified was there is a lot of man powers usage to analyze the problems such as fire accidents, road accidents and to carry on these messages to the respective division without the help of man power. As these problems are only identified by the man power which makes them uncomfortable in some of the times so this can be solved by a unarmed aerial vehicle (Drone) and also by using the drone it is possible to reduce the time period which is generally consumed by the man-power to communicate messages.</p>

        <h1 class="hed">ABSTRACT</h1><br/><br/><br/>
        <p>Drones are used in many applications such as spying in military bases, delivering first aid kits and for larger aerial view photographs. Here is a proposal idea of patrolling drone which uses AI and ML technology to sense the activities such as fire and road accidents, where those type of activities are communicated with the respective departments for faster rescue operation. Once if there is a detection of fire and road accidents then the drone automatically transmits the location and the type of accident occurred with the respective departments by this way of approach major affect caused due to those problems can be reduced. Here, the simulation model is done by using Python program. The simulation model practiced on Python version 3.9.11 has two parts of simulation where, one is made for detection of fire accidents and the other one is made for detection of road accidents and the prototype model is developed where, the output from the drone is transmitted to the respective departments once after identification of road and fire accidents. This way of approach is attained by the usage of image classification technique.</p>
